In this folder, you will find the code used to export the play-by-play data of the CFL API.

## [Guide for play-by-play data](https://github.com/Nicolas-Schonau/sports-data-analysis/blob/master/CFL/Guide_API_play_by_play.ipynb)

This is a detailed, step-by-step guide on how to export all the play-by-play data of the CFL via their API. You will need to ask for a private key to connect to the API, after that you can use the code to export all the data you are interested into.
Attention: the API grants access to raw, unfiltered data. Thus, they don't always necessarily comply with the official, cleaned and grouped data published on the CFL Website.
