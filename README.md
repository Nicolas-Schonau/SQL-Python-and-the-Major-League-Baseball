# Sports data analysis

## Aim
In this repository, you will find some of my works in sports data analysis. 

## MLB
The MLB folder focuses on SQL queries in order to explore the data gathered for the 2019 season. 
A correlation analysis between the payroll and the amount of wins of each teams is available via Python.
Finally, a Power Bi dashboard displays the best pitchers of the 2019 season, including visualisation of the types of pitches they use the most.

## NFL
In the NFL folder you will mostly find analysis on the Expected Points Added and Win Probability added for each QB and teams for the 2020 season. 
The Python code used extracts data from the nflfastR package and focuses on the detailed analysis plus the visualisation used.

## CFL
The Python code in the CFL folder is a tutorial on how to query the CFL API to get play-by-play data for your own analysis.
