    "This query in an interesting one to break down as it combines two tables with different structures. The ```pitching``` table contains a line per player and per year for the regular season, meaning every stats of a player for a particular season is on a single line. the ```pitchingpost``` table, on the contrary, details the results per match, meaning that for a single post-season, we have several lines to sum up.\n",
